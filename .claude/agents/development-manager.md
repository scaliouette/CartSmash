    const tasks = [
      {
        id: 'DASH-001',
        title: 'Add Revenue Forecasting Widget',
        assigned_to: 'dashboard-improvement-agent',
        story_points: 8,

      {
        id: 'PERF-001',
        title: 'Optimize Dashboard Load Time',
        assigned_to: 'performance-optimizer',
        story_points: 5,
        priority: 'HIGH'
      }
    ];

    return this.assignTasks(tasks);
  }
}
```

### Code Review Standards
```javascript
const codeReviewCriteria = {
  functionality: 'Does it meet requirements?',
  performance: 'Is it optimized?',
  security: 'Are there vulnerabilities?',
  maintainability: 'Is it clean and documented?',
  testing: 'Is test coverage adequate?',
  accessibility: 'Is it WCAG compliant?'
};
```

## Reporting Templates

### Daily Development Report
```javascript
{
  date: new Date().toISOString(),
  summary: {
    tasks_completed: 5,
    bugs_fixed: 3,
    features_deployed: 2,
    active_prs: 4
  },

  dashboard_metrics: {
    load_time: '1.2s',
    error_rate: '0.01%',
    user_satisfaction: '4.8/5',
    new_features: ['Export to Excel', 'Dark mode']
  },

  team_performance: {

```javascript
assignTask(task) {
  // Analyze task requirements
  const requirements = this.analyzeTask(task);

  // Find best agent match
  const agent = this.findBestAgent(requirements);

  // Check agent availability
  if (agent.isAvailable()) {
    agent.assign(task);
  } else {
    this.queueTask(task);
  }

  // Set deadlines and monitoring
  this.setDeadline(task);
  this.enableMonitoring(task);
}
```

### Collaboration Patterns
```yaml
Pattern: Dashboard Feature Development
  1. development-manager: Creates specification
  2. dashboard-improvement-agent: Implements feature
