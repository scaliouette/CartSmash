CartSmash is an AI-powered grocery list parser that transforms any grocery list into organized, ready-to-order
  products. We want to integrate with Instacart's Developer Platform API to create a seamless shopping experience:

  Specific API Integration Plans:
  1. Retailers API: Find nearby Instacart partner stores based on user location
  2. Shopping List APIs: Convert our parsed grocery lists into Instacart shopping lists
  3. Connect APIs: Enable users to link their Instacart accounts for direct cart population
  4. Shopping Widgets: Embed Instacart purchasing widgets within our application

  Implementation Approach:
  - Start with development API keys for testing in sandbox environment
  - Build integration with nearby retailer discovery and shopping list creation
  - Apply for production API keys once development is complete
  - Implement secure API key management following Instacart's security guidelines

  User Flow: User pastes/types grocery list ‚Üí AI parses items ‚Üí Match products via Instacart API ‚Üí Create shopping
  list ‚Üí User completes purchase through Instacart

  Expected Usage: 100-500 API calls daily initially, scaling with user adoption. Focus on product matching and
  shopping list creation APIs.
